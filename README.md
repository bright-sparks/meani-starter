# MEANI Starter app
 
 MEANI fullstack integrates ionic material into angular-fullstack generator and shares controller and services between the webapp and ionic app. It has full login/social login functionality, dashboard page, slide menu, ui-calendar integration and template pages too.


## Installation
```bash
npm install
```
```bash
bower install 
```
 
## Usage

```bash
grunt serve
```

## Usage
I'm actively developing it so there are still things to do and a lot more to DRY out. My goal is to share all code between webapp and iopnic app except the views of course.
Express server just recognises the device type, so if you socially login using the ionic app on chrome it won't redirect to ionic apps dashboard. It works on iohone-android simulators though.
